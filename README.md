**Description**  
  Using D3.js to load JSON data from an API, incorporate the data into an interactive dashboard using Plotly in JavaScript.  
  The dash board shows the demographic info about the subject (identified by id), the top 10 OTUs found on their navel (based on sample values) on a horizontal barchart, all the OTU found in a bubble chart, and a gauge to show their washing frequency.
